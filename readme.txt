Design based on https://codepen.io/antibland/pen/ypagZd. Used React as it is a library that I like and am familiar with.

Hopefully the code and the comments I provided to some sections of it help to understand how the game functions.

I didn't put too much time and effort into the actual visual design of the game, as that is an area that can be endlessly improved upon. Similarily the debug section is not the best looking due to time constraints.

I feel that I managed to mostly avoid using hacks - except for the winlines. I couldn't come up with a decent non-hack approach other than some assets, which I unfortunately can't provide.
Also, ideally the coordinate system used widely in the Reel component should be made to be based on fractions of symbol heights. That is something to potentially improve upon for code expandability.

Use 'npm start' command from the 'slotmachine' to run the dev instance.
